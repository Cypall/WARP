## Client side
> Available for all dates from **2010-08** to **2021-01**

> Colors for all item names can be customized in the lua file irrespective of slotted or not.

> As shown, you also have the option of specifying individual colors based on how many slots are occupied for an equipment item.

> In addition to the global name color, it is also possible to change the colors used in the popup balloon seperately.

## Server side
> Since this version is purely client-side there are no server-side edits.

## What's included?

### Common items for the client
- There are 2 lua files required (one which houses the color table and the other has the functions). Both of these will be provided.

- Since the colors are completely under your control, the 1st lua file will simply have the empty tables

- An instruction file will be provided to guide you with filling the table for your own items.


### Modified client (only for Option 1 mentioned below)

- A fresh client with the specified date will be patched and provided.

- If you need the patch on your own modified client, the charges may or may not vary depending on the client provided.

### Script (only for Option 2 mentioned below)
- A set of encrypted script (EJS) files will be provided which defines the patch function & associated functions specific for your client date.

- `Premium.yml` file will be provided which is automatically imported by `Patches.yml`.

- If the YAML file is already present, you can simply add the entries there.
