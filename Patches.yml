#Should contain a mapping of patch names to it's various details like below.
 
#GroupName1:
#  title : Group 1
#  mutex : true
#  color : red
#  allowSkip : true
#  
#  patches:
#      - PatchName1:
#          title : Patch No. 1
#          recommend : yes
#          author : Neo-Mind
#          desc : Just a template to show how to define patches. Still need the function defined though. In this case it is 'PatchName1'
#          allowSkip : false
#      
#      - PatchName2:
#          desc : Alright you get the gist. In this one PatchName2 will become the title, it will not be 'recommend'ed and author is 'Unknown'
#
#GroupName2: #In this one, group's title will be GroupName2, mutex will be true and color will be the default set as per Style.
#
#  patches:
#      -PatchName3: Now even the description becomes empty
#
# ... and so forth
#
#
#
#include: <filename> #For including additional patch definition files like this one. This can also be a list
